How I targeted the Reddit CEO with Facebook ads to get an interview at Reddit 

我是如何通过给 Reddit CEO 推送 Facebook 广告而得到面试机会

A bit over 2 years ago I was coming off a failed startup and out looking for new opportunities. I am not a fan of looking for jobs, my style is to target interesting companies and convince them to let me join them in their quest. So I decided to target Reddit because it looked like they were making some new moves. And, because, it’s Reddit!
两年多前，我从一家失败的创业公司出来，寻找新的机会。我不喜欢找工作，我的风格是瞄准有趣的公司，说服他们让我加入。最终我决定把 Reddit 作为目标，因为它看起来像是在做一些新的动作。而且，因为它是 Reddit！

I hatched the hare-brained scheme to write a blog article that might catch the attention of a particular person, get them to read it somehow, and then say “hey kid, I like the cut of your jib, do you want to come help us conquer the world?”. Sure, that person is actually younger than me, but you get the point.
我策划了一个开脑洞的计划，写一篇可能引起某人注意的博客文章，让他以某种方式阅读它，然后他会说:「嘿，孩子，我喜欢你做事的方式，你能来帮我们征服世界吗？」当然，那个人实际上比我年轻，但你明白我的意思。
I wanted to work at Reddit. Well, not just work at Reddit, but develop something very cool at Reddit that I think can make a huge impact on the business. So I wrote about it. I knew that the CEO of Reddit was a technical founder, so I put quite a deal of effort into that blog entry to try to impress him. Now, how to get him to see it?
我想在 Reddit 工作。嗯，不仅仅在 Reddit 工作，而是在 Reddit 上开发一些非常酷的东西，我认为它可以对业务产生巨大的影响。因此我写了一篇关于它的文章。我知道 Reddit 的 CEO 是一个技术创始人，所以我花了很多精力在那个博客里，试图给他留下深刻印象。现在的问题是，怎样才能让他看到呢？

My first thought was email. I can just email him! But that’s boring. What about getting my article to the top of Hacker News? I bet the CEO (and founder) of Reddit still frequents Hacker News. It is an amazing community, built off an early version of Reddit, and run by Y-Combinator (which incubated Reddit way back when). The problem is, I didn’t think my article would be interesting enough to a large crowd to make it to the top of HN.
我的第一个想法是电子邮件。我可以给他发邮件！ 但是这很无聊。把我的文章放到 Hacker News 的顶端怎么样？ 我敢打赌 Reddit 的 CEO (和创始人)仍然经常光顾 Hacker News。这是一个令人惊奇的社区，它是由早期版本的 Reddit 建立起来的，由 Y-Combinator 运营(它在很早以前就孵化了 Reddit)。问题是，我不认为我的文章对于大多数人来说是有趣的，这样它就无法被`顶到` Hacker News 的顶端。

Then I remembered a trick a friend of mine taught me a while back. That friend (who shall remain nameless, unless he wants me to name him) was running a startup and was using a very interesting technique to increase his chances of closing deals. Who wants to buy from a company they have never heard of? Not many people. His strategy was to target prospects (as directly as possible) with Facebook ads about his product so that when he called or met with them, they would already know the name. They probably didn’t know why they knew, but they had seen the name before, and that meant a great deal when meeting or speaking for the first time. 
然后我想起了我的一个朋友教我的一个小把戏。那个朋友（除非他愿意，否则我不会说出他的名字）经营一家创业公司，正在使用一种非常有趣的技术来增加他达成交易的机会。谁会从一家从未听说过的公司购买产品？这样的人不会太多。他的策略是在 Facebook 上给潜在客户(尽可能直接地)推送他的产品广告，这样当他打电话或与他们见面时，这些人就已经知道这个产品名字了。他们可能不知道自己为什么知道这个名字，但是他们以前见过这个名字，这意味着当他们和我朋友第一次见面或交谈时，效果会非常好。

So I decided I would target the CEO of Reddit with Facebook ads. 
所以我决定把 Reddit 的 CEO 作为 Facebook 的广告目标。

But how? I didn’t have a big budget so I needed to be clever.
但是怎么做呢？ 我没有一个大的预算，所以需要动脑筋。

It turns out the Reddit CEO had a public Facebook profile, so I could go there to see details about him. Where he lived. What he was interested in. I took that info to the Facebook platform to help narrow down the campaign. But I didn’t want everyone to click on it, just one person. So I custom tailored the ad to directly target the one person I wanted to read it.
事实上，Reddit 的 CEO 在 Facebook 上的个人信息是公开的，所以我可以去那里看看关于他的细节。他住哪儿，他对什么感兴趣。我把这些信息带到了 Facebook 广告平台，以帮助缩小竞投关键词。但是我不想每个人都点击它，最好就一个人。所以我定制了广告词，直接针对我想让他读的那个人。

“Steve: Reddit needs recommendations”
「史蒂夫: Reddit 需要建议」

The ad reached 197 people. 4 People clicked on it. One of them was the CEO of Reddit. I spent a total of $10.62.
这则广告吸引了 197 人。4 人点击了它，其中一个是 Reddit 的 CEO。我总共花了10.62 美元。

Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit, saw my ad, clicked on it, read (probably skimmed) my article, and liked it well enough to send a note to Reddit HR to contact me about a position.

Steve Huffman，Reddit 的 CEO，看到了我的广告，点击了我的广告，阅读（也可能只是浏览）了我的文章，并且很喜欢这篇文章。他安排 Reddit 的人力资源部通知我去面试。

Mission accomplished.
使命达成。
